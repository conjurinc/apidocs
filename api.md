TODO description

## Group Authentication

## Login [/api/authn/users/login]

### Exchange a user login and password for an API key [GET]

Once the API key is obtained, it may be used to rapidly obtain authentication tokens,
which are required to use most other Conjur services.

Passwords are stored in the Conjur database using bcrypt with a work factor of 12.
Therefore, login is a fairly expensive operation.

If you login through the command-line interface, you can print your current
logged-in identity with the `conjur authn whoami` CLI command.

The value for the `Authorization` Basic Auth header can be obtained with:
```
$ echo myusername:mypassword | base64
```

+ Request (application/json)
    + Headers

            Authorization: Basic ZHVzdGluOm5hdStpbHVzMQ==

+ Response 200

+ Response 400

    ```
    # The credentials were not accepted.
    ```

## Authenticate [/api/authn/{login}/authenticate]

### Exchange a user login and API key for an API token [POST]

Conjur authentication is based on auto-expiring tokens, which are issued by Conjur when presented with both:

* A login name
* A corresponding password or API key

---

The Conjur Token provides authentication for API calls.

For API usage, it is ordinarily passed as an HTTP Authorization "Token" header.

```
Authorization: Token token="eyJkYX...Rhb="
```

Properties of the token include:

* It is JSON.
* It carries the login name and other data in a payload.
* It is signed by a private authentication key, and verified by a corresponding public key.
* It carries the signature of the public key for easy lookup in a public key database.
* It has a fixed life span of several minutes, after which it is no longer valid.

Before the token can be used to make subsequent calls to the API, it must be formatted.
Take the response from the `authenticate` call and base64-encode it and strip out newlines.

```
token=$(echo -n $response | base64 | tr -d '\r\n')
```

The token can now be used for Conjur API access.

```
curl --cacert <certfile> \
-H "Authorization: Token token=\"$token\"" \
<route>
```

NOTE: If you have the Conjur CLI installed you can get a pre-formatted token with:

```
conjur authn authenticate -H
```

+ Parameters
    + login (string) - login name for the user/host. For hosts this is `host/<hostid>`

## Group Role

## Get members [/api/authz/{account}/roles/{role_kind}/{role_id}?members]

### Lists the roles that have been the recipient of a role grant [GET]

The creator of the role is always a role member and role administrator.

If role "A" is created by user "U" and then granted to roles "B" and "C",
then the members of role "A" are [ "U", "B", "C" ].

Role members are not expanded transitively.
Only roles which have been explicitly granted the role in question are listed.

**Permission Required**: Admin option on the role


+ Parameters
    + account: demo (string) - organization account name
    + role_kind: group (string) - kind of the role, for example 'group' or 'layer'
    + role_id: v1/ops (string) - ID of the role

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    ```
    [
      {
        "admin_option": true,
        "grantor": "demo:group:v1/ops",
        "member": "demo:group:security_admin",
        "role": "demo:group:v1/ops"
      },
      {
        "admin_option": false,
        "grantor": "demo:user:demo",
        "member": "demo:user:donna",
        "role": "demo:group:v1/ops"
      }
    ]
    ```

## Grant to / Revoke from [/api/authz/{account}/roles/{role_a}/{role_id}?members&member={role_b}]

### Grant a role to another role [PUT]

All of this role's privileges are thereby granted to the new role.

When granted with `admin_option`, the grantee (given-to) role can grant the grantor (given-by) role to others.

`admin_option` is passed in the request body.

**Permission Required**: Admin option on the role


+ Parameters
    + account: demo (string) - organization account name
    + role_a: layer/webhosts (string) - ID of the owner role
    + role_b: group:v1/ops (string) - ID of the role we're granting membership to

+ Request

    ```
    {admin_option: true}
    ```

+ Response 200 (text/plain)

    ```
    Role granted
    ```

+ Response 403

    ```
    # Invalid permissions
    ```

+ Response 404

    ```
    # Role does not exist
    ```

### Revoke a granted role [DELETE]

Inverse of `role#grant_to`.

**Permission Required**: Admin option on the role


+ Parameters
    + account: demo (string) - organization account name
    + role_a: layer/webhosts (string) - ID of the owner role
    + role_b: group:v1/ops (string) - ID of the role we're granting membership to

    # Invalid permissions
    ```

+ Response 404

    ```
    # Role does not exist
    ```

## Group Resource

## List [/api/authz/{account}/resources/{kind}{?search,limit,offset}]

### Find and list resources [GET]

This command includes features such as:

* Full-text search of resource ids and annotations
* Filtering by resource kind
* Search offset and limit
* Display full resource JSON, or IDs only

**Permission Required**

The result only includes resources on which the current role has some privilege.
In other words, resources on which you have no privilege are invisible to you.

+ Parameters
    + account: demo (string) - organization account name
    + kind: host (string) - kind of the resource, for example 'variable' or 'host'
    + search: ec2 (string) - search string
    + limit: 5 (number) - limits the number of response records
    + offset: 0 (number) - offset into the first response record

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    ```

## Check [/api]

Check whether a role has a certain permission on a resource.

There are 2 routes here:
* The first route uses the currently logged-in user as the role.
* The second route allows you to *specify* the role on which to check permissions.

Note that in the examples, we are checking if a role can fry bacon.
Conjur defines resource and role types for common use cases, but you
are free to use your own custom types.

### Check own permissions [GET /api/authz/{account}/resources/{resource_kind}/{resource_id}/?check{&priviledge}]

In this example, we are checking if we have `fry` privilege on the resource `food:bacon`.

The response body is empty, privilege is communicated through the response status code.

**Permission required**

You must either:

* Be the owner of the resource
* Have some permission on the resource
* Be granted the role that you are checking (which includes your own role)

You are not allowed to check permissions of arbitrary roles or resources.

+ Parameters
    + account: demo (string) - organization account name
    + resource_kind: food (string) - kind of the resource, for example 'variable' or 'host'
    + resource_id: bacon (string) - ID of the resource you're checking
    + privilege: fry (string) - name of the desired privilege, for example 'execute' or 'update'

+ Response 204
The privilege is held; the role is allowed to proceed with the transaction.

+ Response 403
The request is allowed, but the privilege is not held by the role.

+ Response 404
The role is not allowed to check permissions on this resource.

### Check another role's permissions [GET /api/authz/{account}/roles/{role_kind}/{role_id}/?check{&privilege,resource_id}]

In this example, we are checking if the user 'alice' has
`fry` privilege on the resource `food:bacon`.

The response body is empty, privilege is communicated through the response status code.

**Permission required**

You must either:

* Be the owner of the resource
* Have some permission on the resource
* Be granted the role that you are checking (which includes your own role)

You are not allowed to check permissions of arbitrary roles or resources.

+ Parameters
    + account: demo (string) - organization account name
    + role_kind: user (string) - kind of the role, for example 'user' or 'host'. If the role is not specified, the currently authenticated role is used.
    + role_id: alice (string) - ID of the role. If the role is not specified, the current authenticated role is used.
    + resource_id: food:bacon (string) - the kind and ID of the resource, joined by a colon
    + privilege: fry (string) - name of the desired privilege, for example 'execute' or 'update'

+ Response 204
The privilege is held; the role is allowed to proceed with the transaction.

+ Response 403
The request is allowed, but the privilege is not held by the role.

+ Response 404
The role is not allowed to check permissions on this resource.

## Group User

A `user` in Conjur represents an identity for a human.

## Show [GET /api/users/{login}]

Retrieve a user's record.

The response for this method is similar to that from create,
but it **does not contain the user's API key**.

The login parameter must be url encoded.

**Permission Required**

`read` permission on the user's resource.

---

**Response**

|Code|Description|
|----|-----------|
|200|The response body contains the user's record|
|403|You don't have permission to view the record|
|404|No user exists with the given login name|

+ Parameters
    + login: alice (string) - The user's login

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    ```
    {
      "login":"alice",
      "userid":"admin",
      "ownerid":"ci:group:developers",
      "uidnumber":1234567,
      "roleid":"ci:user:alice",
      "resource_identifier":"ci:user:alice"
    }
    ```

## Create [POST /api/users]

Create a Conjur user.

The response when creating a user contains the user's API key.
This is to support passwordless users.
When other methods (show, for example) return the user as a JSON document,
the API key is **not** included.

When a user is created, the user is owned by itself as default,
and this is not generally what you want.
You can use the `ownerid` parameter to give ownership of the role
to a particular group when it is created.

    }
    ```

## Update Password [PUT /api/users/]

Change a user's password.

In order to change a user's password, you must be able to prove that you
are the user. You can do so by giving an `Authorization` header with
either a Conjur authentication token or HTTP Basic Auth containing
the user's login and old password.
Note that the user whose password is to be updated is determined by
the value of the `Authorization` header.

This operation will also replace the user's API key with a securely
generated random value. You can fetch the new API key using the
Conjur CLI's `authn login` method.

---

**Header**

|Field|Description|Example|
|----|------------|-------|
|Authorization|Conjur authentication token or Http Basic Auth|"Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ=="|

**Request Body**

The new password, in the example "n82p9819pb12d12dsa".
