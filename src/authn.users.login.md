## Login [/api/authn/users/login]

### Exchange a user login and password for an API key [GET]

Once the API key is obtained, it may be used to rapidly obtain authentication tokens,
which are required to use most other Conjur services.

Passwords are stored in the Conjur database using bcrypt with a work factor of 12.
Therefore, login is a fairly expensive operation.

If you login through the command-line interface, you can print your current
logged-in identity with the `conjur authn whoami` CLI command.

The value for the `Authorization` Basic Auth header can be obtained with:
```
$ echo myusername:mypassword | base64
```

+ Request (application/json)
    + Headers

            Authorization: Basic ZHVzdGluOm5hdStpbHVzMQ==

+ Response 200

    ```
    # The response body is the API key.
