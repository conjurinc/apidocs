## Set Expiration [/api/variables/{id}/expiration{?duration}]

### Set an expiration timestamp for a variable [POST]

:[min_version](partials/min_version_4.6.md)

You can set an expiration time for variables in Conjur.
After a variable expires, attempts to retrieve its value will fail.
Variable expiration will generate an audit event.

When a variable is set to expire, it will be marked with an annotation named
`expiration/timestamp`. The value of this annotation will be an ISO8601 UTC timestamp.

`duration` is specified in [ISO8601 duration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).
<br>
For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds".

If `duration` is not provided, or if the length of `duration` is zero (`P0Y`),
the variable will expire immediately.
