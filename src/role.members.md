## List members [/api/authz/{account}/roles/{kind}/{id}?members]

### Lists the roles that have been the recipient of a role grant [GET]

The creator of the role is always a role member and role administrator.

If role "A" is created by user "U" and then granted to roles "B" and "C",
then the members of role "A" are [ "U", "B", "C" ].

Role members are not expanded transitively.
Only roles which have been explicitly granted the role in question are listed.

**Permission Required**: Admin option on the role
