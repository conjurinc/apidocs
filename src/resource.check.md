## Check [/api]

Check whether a role has a certain permission on a resource.

There are 2 routes here:
* The first route uses the currently logged-in user as the role.
* The second route allows you to *specify* the role on which to check permissions.

Note that in the examples, we are checking if a role can fry bacon.
Conjur defines resource and role types for common use cases, but you
are free to use your own custom types.

### Check your own permissions [GET /api/authz/{account}/resources/{kind}/{id}/?check{&priviledge}]

In this example, we are checking if we have `fry` privilege on the resource `food:bacon`.

The response body is empty, privilege is communicated through the response status code.

**Permission required**

You must either:

* Be the owner of the resource
* Have some permission on the resource
* Be granted the role that you are checking (which includes your own role)

You are not allowed to check permissions of arbitrary roles or resources.
