## Authenticate [/api/authn/users/{login}/authenticate]

### Exchange a user login and API key for an API token [POST]

Conjur authentication is based on auto-expiring tokens, which are issued by Conjur when presented with both:

* A login name
* A corresponding password or API key

---

The Conjur Token provides authentication for API calls.

For API usage, it is ordinarily passed as an HTTP Authorization "Token" header.

```
Authorization: Token token="eyJkYX...Rhb="
```

Properties of the token include:

* It is JSON.
* It carries the login name and other data in a payload.
* It is signed by a private authentication key, and verified by a corresponding public key.
* It carries the signature of the public key for easy lookup in a public key database.
* It has a fixed life span of several minutes, after which it is no longer valid.

Before the token can be used to make subsequent calls to the API, it must be formatted.
Take the response from the `authenticate` call and base64-encode it and strip out newlines.

```
token=$(echo -n $response | base64 | tr -d '\r\n')
```

The token can now be used for Conjur API access.

```
curl --cacert <certfile> \
-H "Authorization: Token token=\"$token\"" \
<route>
```

NOTE: If you have the Conjur CLI installed you can get a pre-formatted token with:

```
conjur authn authenticate -H
```
