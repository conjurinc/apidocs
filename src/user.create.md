## Create [/api/users]

:[deprecation_warning_4.8](partials/deprecation_warning_4.8.md)

### Create a new user [POST]

Create a Conjur user.

The response when creating a user contains the user's API key.
This is to support passwordless users.
When other methods (show, for example) return the user as a JSON document,
the API key is **not** included.

When a user is created, the user is owned by itself as default,
and this is not generally what you want.
You can use the `ownerid` parameter to give ownership of the role
to a particular group when it is created.
